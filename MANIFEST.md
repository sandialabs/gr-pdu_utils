This GNU Radio module contains tools for manipulation of PDU objects. There are blocks to translate between streams and PDUs while maintaining timing information, a number of self explanatory blocks that emulate the behavior of some in-tree stream blocks for messages and PDUs, and some other features. This module is complimentary to the gr-timing_utils module and some of the advanced timing features require blocks there.
